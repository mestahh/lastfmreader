============

Last FM info reader.

This is an experimental project for using the Last.fm API. 

In the beginning only two services will be implemented. 

  * getting the artist's bio
  * getting the list of similar artists
  
This small component is basically a CLI, but can be used in a multi-threaded environment and as a component as well.
